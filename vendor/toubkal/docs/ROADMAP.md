# ToubkalCAD — Advanced Features & Ribbon UI Roadmap

> Drafted 2026-06-06. Reference app for the UI: **Chili3D** (xiangechen/chili3d) —
> same stack as us (TypeScript + OCCT 7.8 → WASM + Three.js), Office-style ribbon.

## Context: where we already are

Full 2D sketch suite, extrude/revolve/loft/sweep, primitives, booleans, per-edge
fillet/chamfer, 15 parametric 2D constraints (LM solver), STEP/IGES, undo/redo,
dark theme, SVG icon set. The toolbars (`CADToolbar`, `AdvancedToolbar`) are single
`flex` rows with `overflowX:auto` — every new feature lengthens the scroll. The
ribbon fixes this structurally.

### Architecture note (read before using any "blueprint" code)
Our app uses `CADGeometryRegistry` (singleton, owns OCC shapes), `ThreeMeshCache`,
CustomEvents (`cad-add-mesh`, …), `Occ*Service` modules, and `window.oc`. We do
**not** keep OCC shapes in Zustand. Any pasted hook that assumes a
`useCadStore` with `sceneTree`/`previewMeshData`/`addSolidEntity` must be
re-homed onto our registry + service + event pattern. Reuse algorithms, not plumbing.

### Blueprint API corrections (verified against OCCT 7.8)
- `GeomAPI_To3d` / `const 3dHelixCurve` → not real / illegal identifier. Real helix:
  2D line on `Geom_CylindricalSurface` → `BRepBuilderAPI_MakeEdge(curve2d, surface)`
  → `BRepLib::BuildCurves3d` → `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipe`.
- `BRepVertic_MakePrism_1` → typo for `BRepPrimAPI_MakePrism`.
- `BRepAlgo_NormalProjection` → it's `BRepOffsetAPI_NormalProjection`.
- Tessellator `tri.Nodes()/.Triangles()` is pre-7.x → 7.8 uses `triangulation.Node(i)/.Triangle(i)`. Keep our existing working tessellator.
- `compound.Located(new TopLoc_Location())` is **not** a deep clone; use
  `BRepBuilderAPI_Copy` for true isolation. Prefer the registry lifetime model.
- The blanket "track all + purge in finally" pattern deletes shapes you still need.
- `BRepOffsetAPI_ThruSections` (Loft) `.CheckCompatibility(flag)` semantics are the
  reverse of what they read like. **`true` (the fix)** is what makes profiles with
  DIFFERENT edge counts loftable — OCCT splits edges to a common count, then
  recomputes each wire's seam origin + winding to minimise twist (start-to-start,
  same orientation). **`false`** asserts the wires *already* align edge-for-edge;
  true only for matched profiles (circle→ellipse, both 1 edge). For a 4-edge
  rectangle → 1-edge circle, `false` maps corners arbitrarily → a self-intersecting,
  zero-volume, BRepCheck-invalid solid (the "bowtie"). Verified headlessly in
  `scripts/test-loft-twist.mjs`: `false` → invalid in every mismatch case; `true` →
  one valid solid for pentagon/triangle/N-gon→circle, opposite winding, and rotated
  seams alike. `SetSmoothing(true)` is orthogonal (surface smoothness, not vertex
  mapping) and does not fix this. Guide curves are a separate feature (loft *path*)
  and are not well-supported by `ThruSections` in opencascade.js — not needed here.

## Part 1 — Customizable Ribbon (UI)

Data-driven ribbon: a config of `tabs → groups → commands`, where each command is
`{ id, icon, label, run, enabled }`. Once commands are config (not hardcoded JSX),
"customization like Office" is nearly free.

- **R1 — Command registry** ✅ *(done 2026-06-06)*: every toolbar handler is now a
  `commands` map entry keyed by id (`Ribbon.tsx`).
- **R2 — Ribbon shell** ✅ *(done 2026-06-06)*: tab strip (Sketch · Model · Modify ·
  Tools) + active-tab command row + persistent zone. Both flat toolbars deleted.
- **R3 — Contextual tabs**: auto-show/switch to a "Sketch" tab during a sketch session.
- **R4 — Quick Access Toolbar + Customize dialog**: pinnable favorites; show/hide &
  reorder commands; persist to localStorage.

Tab layout: **Sketch** · **Model** · **Modify** · **Tools** (+ persistent zone:
plane indicator, sketch-session badge, undo/redo).

---

## Part 2 — Advanced features (dependency-ordered tracks)

### Track S — Sketch & 2D editing
- **S1** ✅ *(done 2026-06-07)* Trim / Extend / Split for sketch **lines**.
  `SketchEdit2D.ts` (pure 2D analytic intersections, line×line + line×circle) +
  `useCADSketchEdit` hook (`EDIT_TRIM/EXTEND/SPLIT` modes, raycast sketch wires,
  delete-original + create-segment nodes). Ribbon: Sketch ▸ Modify ▸ Trim/Extend/Split.
  Scope: target must be a line; cutters may be lines or circles. Circle/arc/spline
  targets deferred (would need arc sketchGeom + OCC arc splitting).
- **S2** ✅ *(done 2026-06-07)* Sketch on a 3D face. `OccFaceService.extractPlanarFaces`
  (per-face triangle soup + gp_Pln → workplane) + `useCADSketchFacePick` hook
  (`FACE_SKETCH` mode, transparent face overlays, hover, click → `startSketchSession`).
  Ribbon: Sketch ▸ Datum ▸ "On Face".
- **S3** Project edges to sketch (`BRepOffsetAPI_NormalProjection`). Needs S2.

### Track T — Transforms & patterns
- **T1** ✅ *(done 2026-06-07)* Mirror (`OccTransformService.mirror`, `gp_Trsf`
  about `gp_Ax2`; XY/YZ/ZX). Ribbon: Model ▸ Transform ▸ Mirror.
- **T2** ✅ *(done 2026-06-07)* Linear & circular patterns (`OccTransformService`,
  compound via `BRep_Builder` — not boolean loops). Ribbon: Lin/Circ Array.
  Future: grid & mirror-pattern variants, face/plane-pick instead of axis index.

### Track M — 3D operations
- **M1** Shell / ThickSolid (`BRepOffsetAPI_MakeThickSolid`): pick faces + thickness.
- **M2** Offset shape (`BRepOffsetAPI_MakeOffsetShape`).
- **M3** Draft angle (`BRepOffsetAPI_DraftAngle`).
- **M4** Section / slice (`BRepAlgoAPI_Section` with `gp_Pln`).
- **M5** Variable-radius fillet (`BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet.Add(r1, r2, edge)`).
- **M6** Helical sweep / thread (corrected API above).

### Track E — Extrusion (CATIA-style Pad / Pocket)
Reference: CATIA V5 Pad/Pocket dialog. All options are fields on the extrude
node's `params.opParams` (a numeric superset of the original `{ h }`), driven
from the shared `Op3DPanel`. The Ribbon **Extrude** button opens this panel
(was a one-shot height prompt). Geometry lives in `OccExtrusionService.extrude`;
the boolean step reuses `OccBooleanService`.

- **E1** ✅ *(done 2026-06-08)* End conditions + reverse. `extrude(oc, wire, {height,
  end:'blind'|'symmetric'|'twoSided', height2, reverse, direction})`. Symmetric /
  two-sided use a **single prism** — shift the base face back by `gp_Trsf` then
  sweep the full length (no extrude-twice + `Fuse` seam). UI: Limit toggle, Limit 1/2
  sliders, Reverse toggle. `gp_Trsf_1`, `BRepBuilderAPI_Transform_2`, `BRepPrimAPI_MakePrism_1`.
- **E2** ✅ *(done 2026-06-08)* Pad / Pocket via explicit target pick. Result toggle
  New/Pad/Pocket; `computeShape` fuses (Pad) or cuts (Pocket) the prism against a
  target solid the user clicks in the viewport. New `EXTRUDE_TARGET_PICK` mode +
  `useCADExtrudeTargetPick` hook (hover-highlight, one-shot click), store field
  `op3DTargetPick`. The consumed target is **hidden** (reversible), not deleted.
  `BRepAlgoAPI_Fuse_3` / `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut_3`.
  - *Known v1 gap:* re-editing a Pad/Pocket back to "New" does not auto-re-show the
    hidden target (toggle it visible in the tree). Fix when P1 feature DAG lands.
- **E3** ✅ *(done 2026-06-08)* Thick (thin-wall). `OccExtrusionService.applyThickWall`
  hollows the prism with `BRepOffsetAPI_MakeThickSolid.MakeThickSolidByJoin`: both cap
  faces (normal ∥ pull dir) are removed and the side walls offset inward by `thickness`
  → an open square/round tube (verified: t=2 on a 10³ box → wall vol 640). UI: Wall (mm)
  slider; composes with end conditions, draft, and the Pad/Pocket boolean. This is also
  the **M1 Shell** foundation. *Deferred:* the open-profile→shell→thicken variant and
  separate inside/outside thicknesses (current pass = single inward wall on a closed
  profile).
- **E4** ✅ *(done 2026-06-08)* Draft angle. `OccExtrusionService.applyDraft` post-
  processes the prism with `BRepOffsetAPI_DraftAngle_2`: planar side walls (normal ⟂
  pull dir, via `TopExp_Explorer` + `GeomAdaptor_Surface`) are tapered about the
  neutral = sketch plane (`gp_Pln_3(origin, pullDir)`). Positive angle narrows toward
  the pull direction (verified: 10° on a 10³ box → frustum vol 688.8). UI: Draft (°)
  slider. Pipeline order: `profile → prism → draft → boolean`. Curved walls (circular
  profiles) left straight in this pass; shares the kernel with **M3**.
- **E5** ✅ *(done 2026-06-08)* Up-to-Face. `OccExtrusionService.extrudeUpToFace`
  over-extrudes past the picked target (extent from `projRange` of target vertices),
  `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut`s the target out, then keeps the solid touching the sketch plane
  (min |projection| ≈ 0) — material fills base → first target surface. Reuses the E2
  target picker (`↥ Face` limit option); errors if the profile doesn't reach the target
  (verified: target block z[20,30] → fill z[0,20], vol 2000). *Deferred:* multi-region up-to-face.
- **E8** ✅ *(done 2026-06-10)* Up-to-Plane (datum). `OccExtrusionService.extrudeUpToPlane`
  trims the profile at an infinite datum plane (origin+normal): plane ⟂ axis → exact
  blind extrude to the distance; tilted plane → over-extrude + half-space trim (slanted
  cap), normal-offset reference like Up-to-Face. UI: `↥ Plane` Limit option + a datum-plane
  dropdown in `Op3DPanel` (persisted as `targetDatumId`). Needs a Track-D datum plane.
- **E6** ✅ *(done 2026-06-09)* Up-to-Next / Up-to-Last — no pick, considers every
  body in the scene automatically. `extrudeUpToNext` over-extrudes, cuts all bodies, and
  keeps the base piece (stops at the nearest surface, reusing `keepBaseSolid`).
  `extrudeUpToLast` intersects the over-extrude with each body (`BRepAlgoAPI_Common`) to
  find the furthest exit, then blind-extrudes to it (filling gaps). UI: "Next"/"Last"
  limit options (verified: blocks z[20,30]+z[40,50] → Next vol 2000, Last vol 5000).
- **E7** ✅ *(done 2026-06-08)* Multi-profile (Multi-Pad). `resolveAllProfileWires`
  detects every enclosed region (`SketchRegions`); `extrudeProfiles` extrudes each with
  the same options and groups them into one `TopoDS_Compound` (`BRep_Builder`). The
  Ribbon Extrude now feeds all regions to the panel (verified: 6²+4² profiles → compound
  vol 260). *Deferred:* per-profile independent depths (true variable Multi-Pad).

### Track C — Topology converters (Chili3D ToFace/ToWire/ToShell/ToSolid)
- **C1** Wire→Face, Faces→Shell (sewing), Shell→Solid, with open-topology error handling.

### Track X — Interchange & selection
- **X1** Mesh export: STL / OBJ / glTF / 3MF.
- **X2** Multi-face selection (Ctrl) + surface-type filter (`GeomAdaptor_Surface.GetType()`).

### Track D — Reference geometry (datum planes / axes / points)
Option-based construction geometry (Offset/Angle/3-Point/Midplane/Tangent…) as
first-class tree features you create then sketch on later, Fusion-style. Replaces the
raw origin+normal Custom-plane UX. Full design + phased plan (D0–D13) + verified OCC
construction cheat-sheet in **[REFERENCE-GEOMETRY.md](./REFERENCE-GEOMETRY.md)**.
Keystone is **D0** (datum node model + persistent amber rendering); **D13** associativity
depends on **P1**.

### Track P — Parametric feature tree (deepest)
- **P1** Feature DAG + downstream recompute with persistent naming
  (`.Generated()`/`.Modified()`) so child features survive parent edits.
- **P2** ✅ Assembly baseline — reusable part instances, persistent geometric
  references, six guided constraint types, iterative solving, exploded views,
  interference checking, BOM, compounds, STEP export, persistence, and dedicated
  test suites are implemented. The dependency-ordered enhancement plan is in
  **[project/assembly-roadmap.md](./project/assembly-roadmap.md)**.

## Recommended sequence
1. **R1 → R2** (ribbon) — kills scroll, makes every later feature a one-line config entry.
2. Quick wins into the ribbon: **T1 Mirror, T2 Patterns, C1 Converters, X1 Export**.
3. **S2 Sketch-on-face** + **M1 Shell** — elevates to real part modeling.
4. **E1 → E2** (Pad/Pocket + end conditions) ✅ + **E4 Draft** ✅ + **E3 Thick** ✅ —
   extrusion is now a real additive/subtractive, taperable, hollowable feature.
5. **R3 / R4** (contextual tabs + customization).
6. **E5 Up-to-Face** ✅ + **E6 Up-to-Next/Last** ✅ + **E7 Multi-Pad** ✅ + **E8 Up-to-Plane**
   ✅ — the whole Pad/Pocket limit family is done. Remaining extrusion polish: per-profile
   depths (variable Multi-Pad).
7. **P1 feature tree** last (also fixes the E2 re-edit visibility gap).
